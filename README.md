For the javaScript coding style for the frontend, we will use ESLint. Install it with "npm i eslint --save" and add ESLint as an extension for VSCode. Once installed, run "npx eslint" and pick the corresponding options and use the airbnb coding style that does everything for you. Your eslint config file should be JSON and in it, add "linebreak-style": 0 in rules.

For the python coding style for the backend, we will use PEP8 with Pylint. Install it with "pip install pylint", its already built in to VSCode. In VSCode hit Ctrl+Shift+P and select Python: Select Linter and choose pylint to integret highlighing inside of VSCode
